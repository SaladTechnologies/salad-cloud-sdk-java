# ContainerGroupStartupProbe

Defines a probe that checks if a container application has started successfully. Startup probes help prevent applications from being prematurely marked as unhealthy during initialization. The probe can use HTTP requests, TCP connections, gRPC calls, or shell commands to determine startup status.
